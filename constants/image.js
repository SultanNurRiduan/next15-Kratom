    description:
      "The harvesting process begins with experienced farmers hand-picking only the most mature and healthiest kratom leaves. This selective method, passed down through generations, ensures that each leaf harvested is at its peak alkaloid concentration, guaranteeing superior quality and potency in the final product. The connection between the harvester and the land is integral, making this more than just a process—it's a tradition rooted in respect for nature.",

    name: "Drying Kratom Leaves",
    image: "/Penjemuran.jpg",
    description:
      "Once harvested, the kratom leaves are gently laid out under the tropical sun to dry naturally. This sun-drying method helps preserve the plant's natural alkaloids while enhancing its aroma and color. The process takes place in open-air drying spaces that allow consistent airflow and sunlight exposure, ensuring the leaves are dried evenly without losing their vital properties. This stage is crucial to maintaining the purity and effectiveness of kratom.",

    name: "Kratom Leaf Refining",
    image: "/Penghalusan.jpg",
    description:
      "After the leaves are fully dried, they undergo a meticulous refining process where they are crushed and sifted to remove any stems, veins, or impurities. The goal is to achieve a clean, consistent texture that sets the foundation for high-quality kratom powder. This step requires precision and care, as the texture and cleanliness of the ground leaves directly impact both the effectiveness and experience of the end user.",

    image: "/ProsesBubuk.jpg",
    description:
      "In the final stage, the refined kratom leaves are finely milled into a smooth, talc-like powder using specialized grinders. The powder is then sifted again to ensure maximum purity and uniformity. This high-quality kratom powder retains the plant’s natural benefits and is now ready to be packaged or processed further. The result is a potent, premium-grade product that reflects the care and craftsmanship involved in every step of its traditional preparation.",
